DETAILED PROJECT PORTFOLIO:
MCP Governance Security Gateway (Dec 2025 – Present):
Enterprise-scale governance and security platform for Model Context Protocol (MCP) based Agentic AI systems.
Tech Stack: MCP, CAP (Node.js), CDS, SAP XSUAA, SAP HANA, SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry
•	Identified critical enterprise adoption blockers when scaling MCP agents from local experimentation to production, including lack of identity attribution, over-privileged access models, absence of centralized kill switches, prompt-injection–driven destructive actions, uncontrolled tool discovery, cross-tenant data leakage, fragmented logging, and shadow MCP server usage.
•	Conceptualized and architected a centralized MCP Governance Gateway to convert MCP from a developer-centric protocol into a governed enterprise platform.
•	Designed a Zero-Trust security model where all MCP capabilities are denied by default and explicitly enabled through centralized governance.
•	Implemented identity-bound execution by integrating SAP XSUAA and JWT-based authentication, ensuring every AI action is traceable to a real human user.
•	Designed fine-grained, capability-level RBAC, moving beyond coarse role-based permissions to tool-level and resource-specific authorization.
•	Built a multi-tenant SaaS architecture on SAP BTP ensuring strict tenant isolation, enterprise-grade auditability, and forensic-ready centralized logging.
•	Implemented a real-time operational kill switch allowing instant shutdown of compromised MCP servers without application restarts.
Overall Impact
•	Enabled secure, production-ready adoption of Agentic AI at enterprise scale.
•	Established governance, accountability, and auditability as first-class AI platform capabilities.
•	Significantly reduced operational, security, and compliance risks associated with AI agent execution.
